Like any GM, I like to give my players as rich an experience as I can. I have many references / journals in game and I wanted those journals to align with my own aesthetic.

The previous version of this is under sanseer-journals which is compatible with Foundry v9. This repo works with v10.

There are still a number of things that require done to refine and polish it all.

As with sanseer-journals, it is primarily for my own personal use.
